# table

--I made this table template of package options for a company I was interviewing with.
--They wanted me to create a table that has 3 options, that is responsive, and that displays the details for thos options.
--I could have did this with html and css only, but I wanted to implement JS to display a different way to do this and not hard code anything.
--This way if you want to change a detail, just edit the JS page and details will auto-update
